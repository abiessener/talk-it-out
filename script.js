/*
1. Start with the number 42 and set that equal to the variable `majorKey`

2. Create conditional logic to check if `majorKey` is greater than or equal to 53
2-1. If true, add 42 to `majorKey`
2-2. If false, subtract 13 from `majorKey`

3. Add a string with a value of 11 to `majorKey`

4. Create an array named `keyChars`, then loop through `majorKey` using the `charAt` method and set `keyChars[i]` to each value

5. Remove the first and last values from `keyChars`

6. Create a new variable. Loop **backwards** through `keyChars` and store each value into the new variable, combining each of the values of `keyChars`

7. `parseInt` both the `majorKey` and the new variable created in Step 6, ensure that both `majorKey` and the new variable are set to these new parsed values.

******* SWITCH PROGRAMMERS *******

8. Add `majorKey` and the new variable created in Step 6 together and store them in `majorKey`

9. If the new value of `majorKey` is less than 60, set `majorKey` equal to 14. If not, check to see if it is equal to 2930, if it is, set `majorKey` equal to 27.
If neither of these are true, set `majorKey` to 2.

10. Create a while loop that counts down from 10 and increments `majorKey` by 1.

11. Create a function that accepts an argument `val`. The function should convert `val` to a string, then drop the first character off the string, but only if there
is more than one character in the string. Return `val` and set `majorKey` to the returned value.

12. Call the function.

13. Console log `majorKey`. 

14. Create an index.html file, link in this JavaScript file. Load in the browser and check the value from Step 13.

15. Your answer should be a string value that equals 7. Is that what you got?
